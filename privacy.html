      <h1>Privacy Policy — Screen Flow Pro</h1>
      <p class="meta"><strong>Effective date:</strong> January 13, 2026</p>
      <p class="meta">
        Screen Flow Pro (“Screen Flow Pro,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices when you use the Screen Flow Pro mobile application (the “App”).
      </p>
    </header>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>1) Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>We do not collect or sell personal data.</strong> The App does not run a backend server and does not transmit your content to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Recordings are created using iOS ReplayKit</strong> and are saved to the Photos app per iOS behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>We store app data locally on your device</strong> (for example: session titles, timestamps, and markers) so you can organize your work.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchases are handled by Apple</strong> through the App Store. We do not receive your full payment information.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>A. Content you create</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        Screen Flow Pro does not receive or upload your recordings to us.
        Your recording content is processed on-device.
      </p>

      <h3>B. App data stored on your device (local-only)</h3>
      <p>
        The App stores certain information <strong>locally on your device</strong> to provide core functionality, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Session metadata</strong> (e.g., title, intent mode, created date/time, duration).</li>
        <li><strong>Timeline markers</strong> (e.g., started/stopped/background/foreground events and time offsets).</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase-related state</strong> (e.g., whether Pro is active, and any locally-tracked credits/limits).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        This local-only data is used to display your library, session detail screens, and related app features.
      </p>

      <h3>C. Broadcast extension (App Group storage)</h3>
      <p>
        When using Broadcast Recording, the ReplayKit broadcast extension may temporarily write recording files to an on-device
        <strong>shared App Group container</strong> so the extension can function correctly. This storage remains on-device and is not uploaded to us.
      </p>

      <h3>D. Photos access</h3>
      <p>
        Screen recordings made via iOS ReplayKit are saved to the Photos app per iOS behavior.
        <strong>The App does not request access to browse or read your Photos library</strong> for the purpose of collecting your photos.
        You can manage Photos permissions in iOS Settings.
      </p>

      <h3>E. Analytics and tracking</h3>
      <p>
        The App does not include third-party analytics SDKs and does not track you across apps or websites.
        We do not create user profiles or collect advertising identifiers.
      </p>

      <h3>F. Diagnostics</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        If you have enabled iOS system diagnostics or crash reporting, Apple may provide aggregated diagnostic information to help improve stability.
        This diagnostic reporting is controlled by your device settings and Apple’s policies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use the information stored locally on your device only to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide the App’s core features (library, session details, markers, and organization tools).</li>
        <li>Maintain purchase state (e.g., Pro status) and enable features you’ve purchased.</li>
        <li>Help ensure app stability (via Apple-controlled diagnostics if enabled on your device).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>4) Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Screen Flow Pro may offer in-app purchases and/or auto-renewable subscriptions processed by Apple via the App Store.
        Apple handles payment information. We do not collect or store your full payment details.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>5) Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data and do <strong>not</strong> share your recordings or personal information with third parties for advertising.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        If you choose to export/share content using iOS share sheets (e.g., Messages, Mail, cloud drives), that sharing is initiated by you and handled by the selected service.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        App data (such as session metadata and markers) is stored locally on your device until you delete it (for example, by deleting sessions in the App or uninstalling the App).
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Recordings saved to Photos are managed by you in the Photos app and may be deleted there at any time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>7) Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Delete sessions:</strong> You can delete sessions from within the App to remove associated local session data.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Photos:</strong> You can delete recordings from the Photos app and manage permissions in iOS Settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage subscriptions:</strong> You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>8) Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Screen Flow Pro is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>9) Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” at the top of this page when changes are made.
      </p>
